Few years ago, I also graduated as a MBA student from [California State University East Bay](https://www.csueastbay.edu/), where I studied the financial models of tech startups and big-name companies in the United States for 4 years. In other words, I know how things work in the tech field, and Iâ€™m excited about continuing my career in tech industry to help startups or small businesses owners transform their ideas into reality.

In my leisure time, I love to read history books, cook for my family and go for running in the beautiful city - [Huizhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huizhou).
