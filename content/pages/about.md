After decades at a [multi-national company](https://www.dextragroup.com/) where I inhabited multiple roles (I mostly work in southern part of China - cities of [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou) & [Hong Kong](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hongkong)), I realized that programming had the potential to greatly improve business performance in nearly every scenario. In one of my recent projects, I designed a payroll software to help reduce manual workload and boost the performance of assembly line workers. The scripts that I wrote ran daily to collect info from end-users’ computers in order to help simplify IT staff procedures and improve user satisfaction. I envisioned that professionals with programming capabilities will play bigger roles in every business in the coming decade. 

Finally, I decided to quit my job to dive deep into the world of coding. I attended [Microverse](https://www.microverse.org/), an online coding school, to master every aspect of skills that professional programmers need in their daily lives, from the technical skills (Ruby on Rails / React / JavaScript / HTML / CSS ) to the soft skills (Pair Programming / Remote Working / Team Collaboration / Mentoring).

Now, I can comfortably build solutions based on ideas, solve business puzzles, and give professional advice with my business acumen and coding knowledge. I love to help businesses grow with coding so that people can focus on creating beautiful things for society instead of simply working on repetitive tasks.

Few years ago, I attended a MBA program in [California State University East Bay](https://www.csueastbay.edu/), where I studied the financial models of tech startups and big-name companies in the United States for 4 years. 

In other words, I know how things work in the tech field, and I’m excited about continuing my career in tech industry to help startups or small businesses owners transform their ideas into reality.

In my free time, I love to go for long runs, read history books, cook healthy food for my family, and travel to new places.
