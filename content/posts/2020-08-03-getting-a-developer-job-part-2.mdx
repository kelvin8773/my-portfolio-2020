I think everyone should have some unique strategies to help themself get a developer job because I believe everyone is different and so is the job on the market.

# First, there are some mysteries during the job searching process.

![Job Search Mysteries](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/i/c5yii3545gxn8osujyrq.png)

### 1.Should I choose the hottest technologies to learn?

Choosing the hottest & the most prominent tech stacks to start and move forward is nothing wrong, just keep in mind that the competition is fierce as well, therefore, your chance to get a job would be lower.

**Suggestion**

- If you already in the job search phase, you probably can't change your tech stack, so just stick with them.
- If you are learning and job searching at the same time, choosing the honest tech stack still the right choice, but you need to think about what is your niche and start to build something around it. (Take **react** for example, among so many other react developers around the world, what makes you outstand others? For example, I picked **testing in react** as one of my niches to move forward).

### 2.Should I only interested in some particular jobs?

When I first start to job search, it is easy to think we should narrow down the scope and focus on the most interesting jobs out there, that is nothing wrong.

But again, please keep in mind, the more strict or tighten your job search criteria are the less chance you will have to get a job.

**Suggestion**
I think only if you are 100% certain about what you want, otherwise, widen your search criteria to see more opportunities out there.

### 3.Should I learn more before applying?

There are always temptations of wanting to learn more, connecting more people, doing more projects, and perfecting your portfolio. But the more time & energy you spend on improving yourself, the less time you will spend on job search, therefore, the chance to get a job would be lower.

In the long run, however, it will help boot up your chance if you have enough time to spend.

**Suggestion**

- spread your time and energy in both improving and job search, and use them wisely
- Take big project during a job search only if you spare enough time for it
- you couldn't perfect everything, chose something it is important to you, and ignore the others.

### 4.Should I only focus on these companies?

Choose open or focus on fewer companies is totally up to you, but again, the more focus you are, the less chance you will expose to job opportunities.

**Suggestion**

- When first start job searching, open to more companies will help understand the market place
- Once having more specific ideas on what kind of job you want, you should start narrowing down the type of company fit those criteria to save energy and time

# Second, Make a plan.

**Please Note**
_You have to give yourself some time to get to know the market and yourself better before jump into the conclusion on what you want._

As my job is finding the right developer job for myself, it seems obvious that I should make a plan.

And it actually not that obvious when I started.

Even I made some plans, they are either too bold or too aggressive that I can't keep follow and eventually failed.

There are many ideas and temptations that led me into different directions and paths that seem can get me to start, except they are not.

**After 3 months, below are some ideas I got:**

1. The first job is really, really, really hard for a junior dev, it might take up to 1 year of searching & applying to get the first developer job (if you are consistent).

2. Although remote or relocation is possible, over 90% of companies located in the US or Euro timezone area, so it is even harder for me to get the first one since I am located in the APAC area.

3. My time and energy are limited, so even I want to try every possible way, I need to choose wisely.

**After rationalizing the situation, I started to make a plan.**

1. I set some measurable targets to complete every week (just like you are at work), such as:

- applying for 20 jobs a week,
- connecting 3 recruiters on LinkedIn every week,
- do a mock interview at pramp.com

2. I start to write technical articles regularly to recording down my journey of job search. (Just a personal preference, a way to networking and learn)

3. I start brainstorm side project ideas, target at:

- Open-source project,
- Frontend related,
- Javascript base,
- lightweight(Can be finished in one month).

**Rational behind**

- I have to put some faith in myself and the industry.

- There are certain things I couldn't change.

  - location/culture/nationality/work permit
  - tech stack (it is not realistic that pick up another tech stack while job searching)
  - background (such as language, work experiences, degrees, etc)

- There are still many things I can change, but I need to choose carefully because I have limited time and energy.

# Third, aim for a bigger goal.

Although this article is talking about finding a job in 2020, we should all aim for a bigger target in the long run.

Still remember why we want to learn code in the first place? Getting a better lifestyle? Love doing problem-solving? Adapting the new changes?

For me is trying to get a better lifestyle. As for now, I aim for a junior frontend developer job.

It has to be a frontend and it has to be a coding related job because I aim for getting into top-tier high-tech companies in 3 years as a senior Frontend developer.

And in 5 to 10 years, I want to start my own business/startup in China.

Once these goals have been set, I have a better idea of what kind of company I am looking, and what kind of job I should give more thought about.

For example, I am more tended to join startup companies vs. established companies, I think a more versatile role is better than a more static role because of the reason above.

I knew many developers written about their job searching journey every month, but I still want to have my own version here to remind me how I get through the process.

I wrote this article mostly is for self-encouragement and self-affirmation, I can't say the above strategy will work, but I can say it is most suitable for me now.

I do hope from the process and thinking I shared here, you will be inspired and make your own strategy on your job search journey. And I would love to hear comments and suggestions from you.

Finally, I do get inspiration and idea from some other resources, I will share them below, hope can help you as well.
